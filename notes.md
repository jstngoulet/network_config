> Comments of Walkthrough:

> Sign in the server, CS436.CS.CSUSM.EDU using campus credentials. This may be done using SSH on a Terminal Window, or in PuTTy as mentioned by our instructor.

> Use the 'CD' command to enter the directory in which your project files are stored. We will be reviewing this file's contents plenty.

> Nano / Vim to open example1.tcl to examine the text. Follow the instructions in the tutorial PDF on what the contents actually mean.

> Run the command 'ns example1.tcl'

> Open example1.tr. This is the resulting file from running the above command.

> Think of the series of nodes a nodes in a linked list. The nodes each have a 'node.previous', 'node.next', 'node.firstNode' and a 'node.lastNode'. The previous node is the node in which the packet immediately came from, the next node is where it is headed, the first node is the starting address and the last node is the destination address.
